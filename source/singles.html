                After the release of his critically acclaimed album "Blonde" in 2016, Frank Ocean has released a handful
                of
                singles
                that
                have further cemented his reputation as one of the most innovative and boundary-pushing artists in
                music.
            </p>
            <p class="observe">
                In 2017, Ocean released "Lens," a dreamy track that features introspective lyrics about relationships
                and
                self-discovery. The song was released in two versions, one featuring Travis Scott and the other with
                just
                Ocean's
                vocals.
            </p>

            <p class="observe">
                Later that year, Ocean released "Provider," a laid-back and introspective track that features a dreamy
                instrumental
                and
                poignant lyrics about fame and identity. The song was accompanied by a lyric video that featured Ocean
                playing
                with
                vintage camcorders and creating homemade visuals.</p>
            <p class="observe">
                In 2018, Ocean released "Moon River," a cover of the classic song from the film "Breakfast at
                Tiffany's."
                The
                stripped-down rendition features Ocean's soulful vocals and acoustic guitar, showcasing his ability to
                breathe
                new
                life
                into classic songs.</p>
            <p class="observe">

                In 2019, Ocean released "DHL," a pulsating track that features frank lyrics about love and drug use. The
                song
                was
                released alongside a music video that features grainy footage of Ocean singing and dancing in front of a
                green
                screen.</p>
            <p class="observe">
                Later that year, Ocean released "In My Room," a thumping track that features a hypnotic beat and Ocean's
                trademark
                falsetto vocals. The song was accompanied by a music video that features psychedelic visuals and images
                of
                Ocean
                dancing
                in a dimly lit room.
            </p>
            <p class="observe">

                Overall, Frank Ocean's singles after "Blonde" continue to showcase his ability to push the boundaries of
                modern
                music
                and experiment with different genres and production styles. His unique voice and raw emotion continue to
                captivate
                audiences, and his singles stand as a testament to his lasting impact on the music industry.
